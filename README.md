# Freedoom for Android
<img src="icon.png" width="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"></br>

A fork of nvllsvm's GZDoom-Android port.
My idea for this fork was to bundle this app with the open-source Freedoom (freedoom1.wad and freedoom2.wad) assets to publish a completely open source android game running on the doom engine.
I hope this "bundling" will allow it to reach a more diverse audience of users whom either don't own Doom or are averse to having to find and copy their legally-owned Doom resource files onto their phones.

## Why Freedoom?
While the Doom engine and its many spin-offs are open-sourced, most of the Doom's "assets" such as textures, sounds, and game levels are copyrighted and not legal to redistribute.
The Freedoom project offers an alternative set of assets and game levels that are open-source and can be used with most Doom engines in place of the originals.
In addition, Freedoom is compatible with much of the vast library of fan-made "WADs" (i.e. game levels) as indexed in the idgames archive.


## "Third-party" library versions used (update this whenever they are updated)
- [GZDoom Engine](https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom): [2.0.02/2.0.03](https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/tree/df1364e2d7bc3f23a1a3b7afb4c0be731fe080f8) (SUPER ANCIENT, WE KNOW)
- [Fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth): 1.0.9
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/): 1.3(?)
- FMOD: ??? (version used is not documented anywhere, all we can assume is that it's OLD)


## Roadmap (not in order)
- [ ] Rebase GZDoom Engine to 4.x.x
- [ ] Update FluidSynth from 1.x.x to 2.x.x
- [ ] Update SDL (and SDLActivity.java) from 1.x to 2.x.x
- [ ] Update [OpenGL ES](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/opengl) from 1.0/1.1 to 3.1 (supported by Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher)
- [ ] Switch from using [nvllsvm's MobileTouchControls](https://github.com/nvllsvm/MobileTouchControls) (which is archived, and also a fork of beloko's) to [beloko's](https://github.com/emileb/MobileTouchControls)
- [ ] Integrate an idgames level browser/downloader
- [ ] Add arm64 support to satisfy August 2019 Google Play requirements


## Notes before building
A large portion of this project relies on the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) to compile C++ and C code from GZDoom and other sources for use with this app.
You may need to install additional tools in your development environment before being able to build these portions successfully.
For more information, please read the "Getting Started with the NDK" article from Google.
To my knowledge the environment only compiles towards the ARMV7 architecture as found in smartphones and not towards x86 as found in most traditional computers.
You may need to add support for x86 compilation or emulate the ARMV7 architecture to get this app working on a virtual device.


## Building
If you are running Windows, you may need to execute some of these commands using the Cygwin environment to avoid unexpected behavior.
If you install Cygwin on Windows, you should make sure that the "patch" command is installed with the environment.

You may also need to add your NDK folder to your PATH or add/remove a .bat extension from a command in build.sh depending on your platform.


### Building (cont.)
    git submodule update --init
    ./build.sh
    ./gradlew assemble
